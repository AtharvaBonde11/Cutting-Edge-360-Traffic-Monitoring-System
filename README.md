# üö¶ Cutting-Edge 360-Degree Traffic Monitoring System

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Cutting-Edge 360-Degree Traffic Monitoring System. This project aims to transform urban traffic management by merging multiple video feeds to create a comprehensive 360-degree view of traffic environments. By leveraging advanced technologies such as OpenCV, Open3D, and pix2pix GAN, the system provides real-time, panoramic video outputs that enhance the monitoring and management of traffic conditions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **360-Degree View**: Combines multiple video feeds from different angles to create a seamless 360-degree video.
- **Advanced Depth Estimation**: Utilizes state-of-the-art techniques for accurate depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.
- **Point Cloud Processing**: Generates and processes point clouds for detailed 3D scene representation.
- **GAN-based Video Enhancement**: Applies pix2pix GAN for high-quality video synthesis.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Designed for efficient real-time traffic monitoring and analysis.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository contains the following files:

1. **run.py**: The main script to initialize and run the entire pipeline.
2. **video_reconstruct.py**: Handles the reconstruction of video feeds into individual frames.
3. **point_cloud_estimation.py**: Responsible for estimating point clouds from the reconstructed frames.
4. **stitching_aligning.py**: Aligns and stitches the point clouds to form a continuous panoramic view.
5. **rgb_frames.py**: Manages the extraction and processing of RGB frames from video feeds.
6. **pix2pix_gan.py**: Implements the pix2pix GAN model for enhancing video quality and producing realistic panoramic outputs.
7. **panorama_video_reconstruction.py**: Finalizes the 360-degree panoramic video from the processed frames and point clouds.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To run the project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the necessary dependencies. The recommended way to install these dependencies is through a virtual environment.

### Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/360-degree-traffic-monitoring.git
cd 360-degree-traffic-monitoring
```

### üì¶ Install Dependencies:

To install the necessary dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üöÄ Usage
To start the system, run the run.py script:

```bash
Copy code
python run.py
```
This script will initialize the entire pipeline, from video feed acquisition to panoramic video synthesis.

### üîß Customization
You can customize the input sources, processing parameters, and output settings by modifying the configuration files or parameters within the scripts.
tools, including OpenCV, Open3D, and pix2pix GAN. We extend our thanks to the developers and contributors of these tools.
